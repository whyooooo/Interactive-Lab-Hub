## Part 1.
### Setup 
### Text to Speech 

\*\***Write your own shell file to use your favorite of these TTS engines to have your Pi greet you by name.**\*\*


  
### Speech to Text

Next setup speech to text. We are using a speech recognition engine, [Vosk](https://alphacephei.com/vosk/), which is made by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University. Vosk is amazing because it is an offline speech recognition engine; that is, all the processing for the speech recognition is happening onboard the Raspberry Pi. 

Make sure you're running in your virtual environment with the dependencies already installed:
```
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Test if vosk works by transcribing text:

```
vosk-transcriber -i recorded_mono.wav -o test.txt
```

You can use vosk with the microphone by running 
```
python test_microphone.py -m en
```

---
Bonus:
[Whisper](https://openai.com/index/whisper/) is a neural network–based speech-to-text (STT) model developed and open-sourced by OpenAI. Compared to Vosk, Whisper generally achieves higher accuracy, particularly on noisy audio and diverse accents. It is available in multiple model sizes; for edge devices such as the Raspberry Pi 5 used in this class, the tiny.en model runs with reasonable latency even without a GPU.

By contrast, Vosk is more lightweight and optimized for running efficiently on low-power devices like the Raspberry Pi. The choice between Whisper and Vosk depends on your scenario: if you need higher accuracy and can afford slightly more compute, Whisper is preferable; if your priority is minimal resource usage, Vosk may be a better fit.

In this class, we provide two Whisper options: A quantized 8-bit faster-whisper model for speed, and the standard Whisper model. Try them out and compare the trade-offs.

Make sure you're in the Lab 3 directory with your virtual environment activated:
```
cd ~/Interactive-Lab-Hub/Lab\ 3/speech-scripts
source ../.venv/bin/activate
```

Then test the Whisper models:
```
python whisper_try.py
```
and

```
python faster_whisper_try.py
```
\*\***Write your own shell file that verbally asks for a numerical based input (such as a phone number, zipcode, number of pets, etc) and records the answer the respondent provides.**\*\*

### 🤖 NEW: AI-Powered Conversations with Ollama

Want to add intelligent conversation capabilities to your voice projects? **Ollama** lets you run AI models locally on your Raspberry Pi for sophisticated dialogue without requiring internet connectivity!

#### Quick Start with Ollama

**Installation** (takes ~5 minutes):
```bash
# Install Ollama
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh

# Download recommended model for Pi 5
ollama pull phi3:mini

# Install system dependencies for audio (required for pyaudio)
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y portaudio19-dev python3-dev

# Create separate virtual environment for Ollama (due to pyaudio conflicts)
cd ollama/
python3 -m venv ollama_venv
source ollama_venv/bin/activate

# Install Python dependencies in separate environment
pip install -r ollama_requirements.txt
```
#### Ready-to-Use Scripts

We've created three Ollama integration scripts for different use cases:

**1. Basic Demo** - Learn how Ollama works:
```bash
python3 ollama_demo.py
```

**2. Voice Assistant** - Full speech-to-text + AI + text-to-speech:
```bash
python3 ollama_voice_assistant.py
```

**3. Web Interface** - Beautiful web-based chat with voice options:
```bash
python3 ollama_web_app.py
# Then open: http://localhost:5000
```

#### Integration in Your Projects

Simple example to add AI to any project:
```python
import requests

def ask_ai(question):
    response = requests.post(
        "http://localhost:11434/api/generate",
        json={"model": "phi3:mini", "prompt": question, "stream": False}
    )
    return response.json().get('response', 'No response')

# Use it anywhere!
answer = ask_ai("How should I greet users?")
```

**📖 Complete Setup Guide**: See `OLLAMA_SETUP.md` for detailed instructions, troubleshooting, and advanced usage!

\*\***Try creating a simple voice interaction that combines speech recognition, Ollama processing, and text-to-speech output. Document what you built and how users responded to it.**\*\*

### Serving Pages

In Lab 1, we served a webpage with flask. In this lab, you may find it useful to serve a webpage for the controller on a remote device. Here is a simple example of a webserver.

```
pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub/Lab 3 $ python server.py
 * Serving Flask app "server" (lazy loading)
 * Environment: production
   WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
   Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Debug mode: on
 * Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
 * Restarting with stat
 * Debugger is active!
 * Debugger PIN: 162-573-883
```
From a remote browser on the same network, check to make sure your webserver is working by going to `http://<YourPiIPAddress>:5000`. You should be able to see "Hello World" on the webpage.

### Storyboard

Storyboard and/or use a Verplank diagram to design a speech-enabled device. (Stuck? Make a device that talks for dogs. If that is too stupid, find an application that is better than that.) 

\*\***Post your storyboard and diagram here.**\*\*

Write out what you imagine the dialogue to be. Use cards, post-its, or whatever method helps you develop alternatives or group responses. 

\*\***Please describe and document your process.**\*\*

### Acting out the dialogue

Find a partner, and *without sharing the script with your partner* try out the dialogue you've designed, where you (as the device designer) act as the device you are designing.  Please record this interaction (for example, using Zoom's record feature).

\*\***Describe if the dialogue seemed different than what you imagined when it was acted out, and how.**\*\*

### Wizarding with the Pi (optional)
In the [demo directory](./demo), you will find an example Wizard of Oz project. In that project, you can see how audio and sensor data is streamed from the Pi to a wizard controller that runs in the browser.  You may use this demo code as a template. By running the `app.py` script, you can see how audio and sensor data (Adafruit MPU-6050 6-DoF Accel and Gyro Sensor) is streamed from the Pi to a wizard controller that runs in the browser `http://<YouPiIPAddress>:5000`. You can control what the system says from the controller as well!

\*\***Describe if the dialogue seemed different than what you imagined, or when acted out, when it was wizarded, and how.**\*\*

# Lab 3 Part 2

For Part 2, you will redesign the interaction with the speech-enabled device using the data collected, as well as feedback from part 1.

## Prep for Part 2

1. What are concrete things that could use improvement in the design of your device? For example: wording, timing, anticipation of misunderstandings...
2. What are other modes of interaction _beyond speech_ that you might also use to clarify how to interact?
3. Make a new storyboard, diagram and/or script based on these reflections.

## Prototype your system

The system should:
* use the Raspberry Pi 
* use one or more sensors
* require participants to speak to it. 

*Document how the system works*

*Include videos or screencaptures of both the system and the controller.*
